# Distinct Sum Algorithm

> This algorithm takes 2 arrays of numbers and returns the sum of the distinct element of the arrays.

## Steps
1. Declaration of Algorithm name
2. Variable declaration of the arrays and counters and sum counters.
3. Writing a nexted loop for the two arrays
4. push distinct elements into a new array
5. add up distinct elements to get sum total
